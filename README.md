# I hate waiting
I ordered a new car, I'm really excited about this but I also _despise_ waiting. I seek instant gratitude.

I have no way to combat this, so I made a dumb little app that shows me how long I've been waiting.
Hopefully I won't have to update the delivery date in the wrong direction.
